<h1>Pantorouter plans - cutting diagrams</h1>
This page best printed with the paper orientation set to "landscape" and magnification set to 70%.
<p>
It's advisable to only cut  the parts as you build the machine.  Otherwise, you end up with a lot of small
pieces of wood that you may not remember what they are for.
<p>
Please note that the fence is not included in this cutlist.  I'ts optional, and there's no material for it
if you use a 2'x4' (60x120 cm) piece of plywood.  The fence is  24x17 cm of 3/4" (19 mm) birch plywood.
