<h1>Quick guide to viewing drawings with sketchup</h1>

SketchUp is a 3D CAD program.  Like any 3D cad program, it has a bit of a
learning curve to it if you want to become proficient.  But if you only want to view a drawing,
you only need to know a few things for it to be useful.
<p>
The plan is set up with "scene tabs" at the top of the screen.  Each of these scene
tabs will toggle to a different view of some of the parts.
<p>
In any drawing, you can zoom in and out by rolling the mouse wheel, and pan around
the part by pressing the mouse wheel while moving the mouse.
<p>
In any view with multiple parts on it, you can double click on the part, which
"opens" that part, or group of parts.  Only that part is shown at this point.
This can be useful for viewing one part specifically.  If the part contains sub-parts,
you can double click on those again to view just the sub-parts or sub assemblies.
To back out of opening the parts, just push escape.
<p>
If a part is obstructing your view, you can right click on it and select "hide".  If the part
you want to hide is part of a sub-assembly, you may have to open that assembly first before
hiding the part individually.

is all you need for the plans, no need to buy SketchUp.
