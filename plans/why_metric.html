<h1>Why metric?</h1>
I get questions from time to time if I have plans available in inches.
Unfortunately, converting the plans to inches properly means actually changing
the dimensions of the plans, so that the fractions work out to nice values.  
I went through this exercise of converting my 
<a href="http://woodgears.ca/combolock/plans">combolock plans</a> to imperial,
and I found the exercise of working with an intricate mechanical design in fractional units to be
very time consuming and frustrating, especially when calculations were needed.
<p>
Mechanical engineering simply isn't meant to be done with fractional units.  In fact, most mechanical
engineering work with imperial units is done with decimal inches.   But where can you find a tape 
measure with decimal inches?  I have never seen one.  In the mean time
decimal metric rulers and tape measures are readily available and used all over the world.
<p>
So the solution is quite simple: Design in Metric.

That said, inches are just the right size unit when working with buildings and construction lumber,
but they just aren't very good units to use for engineering work where one deals with small distances
and lots of calculations.

<h3>Generating imperial dimensioned versions of the drawings</h3>
If you prefer to work in 64'th inches, or 1/1000 inches,  instead of centimeters, you can
You can generate imperial dimensions by loading the SketchUp model
into SketchUp, and setting the units to imperial using "Model Info" under the "Window" menu.  
However, the actual sizes
of the machine are all worked out to be even millimeters, so the units will not work out
to nice even values in fractional inches or in thousandths inches.
