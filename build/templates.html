<h1>How to make templates for the pantorouter</h1>
A frequently asked question about the pantorouter is where
to get tenon templates for it.
<p>
However, I do not know what size tenons you would like to make,
which size router bit you want to use, and what size your
follower bearing are.  In addition, it actually makes very
little sense to use paper templates when making tenon
templates on the pantorouter.  However, if your follower bearing
is exactly twice the diameter of your router bit, then the template
needs to be exactly twice the size of your tenon.

The pantorouter can be used many different types of joints.<br>
