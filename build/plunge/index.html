While it would be possible to cut tenons without a plunge mechanism, for mortises, or any 
sort of internal cavity, a plunge mechanism is essential.
<p>
The plunge mechanism works by moving the pantograph and template holder (essentially the rear
half of the machine) towards and away from the stock on linear glides made
from <a href="../sliders/index.html">drawer slides</a>
<p>
An operating lever at the back of the machine activates the plunge mechanism.
this operating lever is made to be sturdy enough to also serve as a sort of hand-hold 
for the left hand while using the main operating lever with the right hand.

To allow the use of longer drawer slides, the plunging "sled" extends to underneath the stock
mounting table.  Two stops are used to limit the amount of travel of the sled.
<p>
The stop towards the right in this photo limits the depth of plunging, while the stop to the
left of it is used to limit how far back the router can move.  Limiting how far back the router
can travel in itself is not all that useful, but sometimes it's desirable to lock the plunge
position in a particular position.  This is done by setting both stops to the same position.
<p>
A bolt protrudes into the slot of the stop on the left.  The stop works by the bolt hitting
the end of that slot.

The plunge lever (top in this photo) has a bracket attached to it, which gives it 
better support against its shaft.  This makes the lever fairly rigid by allowing the 
lever to only tilt left towards and away from the table but not towards and
away from the operator.  This helps to provide a hand hold for the operator.
<p>
Shown below the plunge lever is the link that connects the bottom of the lever to the
table.  The bottom end of the lever is actually held in place by the link, while the
lever's pivot moves with the sled.

<a href="elbow_pivot-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=552>
<img src="elbow_pivot.jpg" width=480 height=331 align=left></a>
The elbow pin for the lever is made from a cut off knockdown screw.  That screw is
the same type used to mount the templates and the knob on the operating lever.
<p>
The holes in the operating lever should be drilled to give a tight fit for the elbow pin, 
while the link fitting into the lever should have a hole large enough to allow it
to turn freely about the pin.

Templates are mounted on the frame behind the router.  These are mounted with knockdown screws
through the frame, or alternately, with clamps from above.
<p>
I also put some small screws into the frame to hold my router collet wrench in place.  You can see
the handle of it in this photo.

<a href="template_holder-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=521>
<img src="template_holder.jpg" width=480 height=312 align=left></a>
The template mounting frame has slots in it to allow the mounting bolts to be moved side to side.
<p>
Two plastic knobs are used to attach the screws, though wing nuts would work just as well.

The material for the template frame was 1.5" (38 mm) thick spruce, which is slightly
blaned down to 36 mm (1 mm off each side) to get smoother, straighter surfaces.
<p>
The corners of the template mounting frame are box joints with fingers 6 mm (1/4") wide.
<p>
These are quickest to cut with a <a href="http://woodgears.ca/box_joint/jig_improved.html">
screw advance box joint jig</a>.  But if you don't have one of these, it's possible to do a decent
job cutting these out with the bandsaw, such as was done for some of the joints
in this <a href="http://woodgears.ca/dovetail/strength.html">joint strength comparison</a>

<img src="drill_press_mortise.jpg" width=480 height=325 align=left></a>
A <a href="http://woodgears.ca/slot_mortiser/index.html">slot mortiser</a> is very handy for cutting
the slots in the frame, although it's necessary to cut in from both sides to get 
all the way through the stock.
<p>
Alternately, you could cut these with a plunge router, or by drilling a series of overlapping
holes on a drill press.  If you use the drill press method, it's important
to use a brad point or forstner bit, and to clamp a drill press vise to your drill press table
to rigidly hold the stock.  Also, push the drill as far into the chuck as possible, and move the
drill press table up so that minimum quill extension is needed to drill the holes.
<p>
You will get cleaner results if you drill half way from both sides instead of all the way from one side..
