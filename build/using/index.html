With the pantograph reducing 2:1 from the template to the router bit, using a guide bearing that is
exactly twice the diameter of your router bit will reproduce the shape of the template exactly.
<p>
Mostly, I use a 3/4" outside diameter bearing and a 3/8" router bit.  Larger bits are better for cutting tenons,
but the 3/8" bit is also useable for cutting mortises or cutting between double tenons.
<p>
Unfortunately, getting a bearing that is twice the size of your router bit is not always possible.  
Ball bearings are mostly in metric units.  Even bearings with hole sizes in inches tend to have 
metric outer diameters.  But router bits in Canada and the US are all sized in inches.

If your bearing is not exactly twice the diameter of your router bit, 
you can calculate the required thickness of 
the tenon template using this formula:<p>

<big>
T<sub><sub>template</sub></sub> = 2 * (T<sub><sub>tenon</sub></sub> + D<sub><sub>cutter</sub></sub>) - D<sub><sub>bearing</sub></sub>
</big>
<p>
For example, if you want to cut a 3/8" tenon with a 1/2" bit and a 26 mm bearing:<br>
<big>T</big><sub>tenon</sub> = 3/8" = 9.53 mm<br>
<big>D</big><sub>cutter</sub> = 1/2" = 12.7 mm<br>
<big>D</big><sub>bearing</sub> = 26 mm<br>
<big>T</big><sub>template</sub> = 2 * 9.53 + (2 * 12.7 - 26) = 18.4 mm

The same formula can also be applied to work out the width of the template:
<p>
<big>L<sub><sub>template</sub></sub> = 2 * L<sub><sub>tenon</sub></sub> + (2 * D<sub><sub>cutter</sub></sub> - D<sub><sub>bearing</sub></sub>)
</big>
<p><br>
Note that the two terms in brackets on the right stay the same as the previous formula.  for any
combination of router bit and bearing that you use, you only need to work this adjustment factor out once.
<p>
I found it easiest to use a round object such as a washer to mark the round part on the end of
the tenon template, then cut that out approximately with a bandsaw, and then use a sander
to smooth out the curve and bring it up to the line.
<p>
With the tenons half the size of the template, any inaccuracies in the template
will also be cut in half.

Of course, getting it completely right may require some experimentation.  If you only need to 
make a small adjustment to a template, you might try shaving it down a little bit with a shoulder 
plane if the fit is too tight, or adding some tape to the template to increase it's size.  I 
like to use UHMW tape to shim things up with, as it's fairly thick and rigid.  The tape
is a milky transparent, so it doesn't show up very well in the photo at left (click the photo to enlarge).

<img src="single_mortise_template.jpg" width=480 height=339 align=left></a>
Making a template for a mortise is much more straightforward.  It's just a matter 
of making a straight track that the bearing can roll in.  With the springs under-compensating 
for the weight of the router, the bearing has a natural tendency to stay in the track, especially 
if one rests one's hand on the operating lever.
<p>
On the template at left, the block on the near end of the track is screwed on, while the other block is held on
with a small C clamp (obscured by the operating lever in the photo).  This way, I can make adjustments to how
long a mortise I want to cut with the machine.

<img src="alignment_lines.jpg" width=480 height=316 align=left></a>
It's easy to mount a template at a slight angle by accident.  Drawing some horizontal lines on the back of the
template is useful as a quick visual check when mounting the templates.  It's also a good idea to trace a line
across the back for some types of joints that you make often so it's easier to get the template at the same
height again.

<a href="multi_joint-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=616>
<img src="multi_joint.jpg" width=480 height=369 align=left></a>
Where the machine really shines is when making more complex joints, especially multiple 
mortise and tenon joints.  Getting a double tenon joint to fit just right
can be tedious.  But with a machine like this, once you make a set of templates for a joint,
it's easy to reproduce it perfectly time and time again.

<a href="multi_templates-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=447>
<img src="multi_templates.jpg" width=480 height=268 align=left></a>
Here are my quadruple mortise and tenon templates.
<p>
I measured the placement of each piece of wood with calipers from the edge as I glued it.
With the templates twice the size of the final joint, I get some leeway in terms of accuracy,
but I still make it as precisely as I can.
<p>
The multiple mortise template on the right is mounted so that the mortises are horizontal, so
that the mortises will be parallel to the grain of a piece of wood clamped horizontally onto the table.
Each track in the mortise template has an opening so that the bearing can be pulled out of the track
and then put into the next track.
<p>
The vertical range of motion of the machine is just barely enough for the quadruple mortise 
template, though I had to cut a corner off the template as the router motor hit the bottom edge of the 
template while I was cutting the topmost mortise.

<a href="gluing_templates-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=606>
<img src="gluing_templates.jpg" width=480 height=364 align=left></a>
Gluing the templates is tricky.  Wet wood glue acts as a lubricant, and clamping the pieces down has a
tendency to move them.  So instead of clamping, I weighed down each piece of wood with something heavy.

<a href="dowel_template-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=420>
<img src="dowel_template.jpg" width=480 height=252 align=left></a>
I also made a multiple dowel template.  Making a template perfectly round is tedious.  I had some 1 1/4"
washers, which were perfect for a template for 5/8" dowels.  And if I use a 1/2" bit instead of a
3/8" bit on my router, this template makes 1/2" dowel ends.

There are spacers behind the washers to bring them out far enough for the bearing.

<img src="integral_dowels.jpg" width=480 height=279 align=left></a>
Here's the integral dowels produced by that template.  Though it looks like three dowels sticking
out, those are actually part of the piece of wood.
<p>
A key to getting a clean cut (click image to enlarge), especially around the edges, is to always 
do a "climb cut" with the router.
Climb cuts are normally considered "unsafe" because the router has a tendency to pull itself into the
stock.  But the pantograph mechanism gives me a lot of mechanical advantage from the handle to the router
bit, so I haven't had any issues.
<p>
With a climb cut, the cutter edge is always cutting into, as opposed to out of the stock.
This prevents any tearout at the edges.  I also found that I get a cleaner cut on my final
dowel with a climb cut.

<a href="dovetails-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=601>
<img src="dovetails.jpg" width=480 height=361 align=left></a>
Here's experimenting with a template for cutting the pins of a dovetail joint.
<p>
Unlike conventional dovetails jigs, I don't have to have my router bit sticking through a guide 
bushing.  This means I can use bigger, longer bits with 1/2" shanks, so that I can cut joints 
that are larger and deeper than with a conventional dovetail jig.
<p>
My pantograph is limited to an 8" range of motion side to side, so anything wider than that 
would require cutting as multiple sections by repositioning the stock.
There isn't anything to get in the way on either side so there's no limit to how large the stock
may be.  The main difficulty with very large stock would be in clamping and aligning.
<p>
The other advantage of not relying on guide bushings is that I could also cut dovetail joints 
much finer than what is possible with a conventional dovetail jig, again, because I'm not 
constrained by the need for my guide bushing large enough to fit around the router bit's shank.

<a href="halfblind-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=461>
<img src="halfblind.jpg" width=480 height=277 align=left></a>
Hand tool enthusiasts like to make dovetail joints with geometries that can't be cut 
with a dovetail jig, which servers to prove that the joint was hand cut.
But some of these joints can be cut with the pantorouter.  The "pins" side of this joint 
was cut with a 1/4" router bit on the pantorouter.
This leaves the corners of my tail cavities round, so some hand tool work is still needed 
to make it look like one of those joints that was "hand cut".  Except that this method
is less work and more accurate.

<img src="heart_shaped.jpg" width=480 height=321 align=left></a>
The possibilities are nearly endless, it's all a matter of what templates one makes.
<p>
At left is an experiment with a heart shaped through tenon.  It was only a quick 
experiment and not very accurate.  But you get the idea.
