Getting the alignment of the pantorouter just right is critical.  The most important aspect
of alignment is to ensure that the router's axis is parallel to the plunge direction 
and level with the table.
<p>
If the router's axis is out of alignment, it's easy to get steps in the 
routed tenon, as shown at left.  This was the result of a rather subtle misalignment
of the router axis.

The best way to check the router's axis is to get a straight metal shaft and put it in the
router collet.  I'm using a 1/4" shaft.  A 1/2" shaft would be even better.
<p>
When putting a shaft in the router, spin the router's collet a bit to see if the shaft wobbles,
just to ensure that your shaft is straight and properly mounted in the router.  Do NOT turn
on the router with the shaft in the collet.  An unbalanced shaft at 10,000 RPM could cause
serious problems.  Best to make sure your router is unplugged before
you put a shaft in the collet.
<p>
The picture at left shows a subtle misalignment.  Move the router side to side along
the width of the table to see if the misalignment direction changes.  
If the misalignment direction doesn't, it's possible that the
shaft that your pantograph is mounted to is misaligned.
<p>
A more likely source of misalignment however is the problem is with the pantograph or
the router mount.

Before taking the pantograph apart, it may be good to do a few more checks with the
assembled unit.  An obvious source of misalignment to look for first is to see if 
the links have any "racking"
in them the way they were put together.  Note how the gap between the links and the operating
lever are at the top right and bottom left.  Try to correct for that before proceeding.  If the
pantograph mechanism really "wants" to go into a racked configuration like this, you probably
have some twist or skew in some of your links.

<img src="checking_links.jpg" width=480 height=352 align=left></a>
There are a few more checks that can be done before taking the whole mechanism apart.
You can check that the pins are perpendicular to the table's edge using a framing square and
a thin ruler.  The ruler is pushed into the gap between the parts until it hits the bearing shaft.
<p>
This check is much easier if you haven't installed the washers in the pantograph yet.
<p>
But overall, if you find that your pantorouter has alignment issues, it's much easier to check
the links individually once you have taken your pantograph apart.

<a href="check_twist-b.png" bigw=800 bigh=570>
<img src="check_twist.png" width=480 height=342 align=left></a>
You can check for twist in your links by inserting two steel shafts in the holes and resting them
on some pieces of wood on top of a flat surface as shown.  Check that the link rests on all four points
on the pieces of wood and doesn't rock back and forth.  Also do this check by inserting two
shafts in the hole of the control lever.
<p>
You don't need a machinist's granite
slab to check this with - your table saw or jointer should be flat enough.  But if you want a really
flat surface, modern glass top cooking stoves are amazingly flat.
<p>
I neglected to take photos of these checks last time I had it apart, so I'm using CAD drawings
to illustrate some of the steps.

<a href="check_parallel-b.png" bigw=800 bigh=573>
<img src="check_parallel.png" width=480 height=344 align=left></a>
Check that the spacing between the shafts is the same on both ends.  A quick check with some calipers
should do the trick.  For the long link, regular calipers won't quite reach, so measure it with a
machinist's ruler.  If it's out by a millimeter, that's too much.  If you can't see a difference
eyeballing it with a ruler, it's close enough.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="check_square-b.png" bigw=800 bigh=654>
<img src="check_square.png" width=480 height=392 align=left></a>
Use a square to check that your links don't have any skew in them.  A machinist's square is good for
this type of check.  If you don't have a machinist's square, use a framing square (the kind that is
made of one piece of thick sheet metal).  Framing squares, in my experience, are on the whole quite
trustworthy.
<p>
Use this method to check the short link, the long link, and the control lever.

<a href="router_check_jig-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=659>
<img src="router_check_jig.jpg" width=480 height=396 align=left></a>
The link that mounts the router is more difficult to check.  Being the most complicated link, it's also
the most likely source of misalignment.
<p>
I'm doing essentially the same check as the first of the CAD drawings above to check for
twist in this photo, but my front piece of wood is bigger and has a notch cut out of it, while the
back is two separate pieces of exactly the same height, to accommodate the router motor.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="check_with_router-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=687>
<img src="check_with_router.jpg" width=480 height=412 align=left></a>
Here I'm checking for skew, again with the router still in place.
<p>
I couldn't put the square straight against the front of the link because the router gets in the
way, so I made some spacers to hold a piece of wood the same distance on both sides.
<p>
This check would be easier to do with the router removed, but I wanted to leave it in
place for the next check.
<p>
It is however necessary to remove the router to check that the spacing of the pins
is correct front and back.

<a href="check_router_yaw-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=650>
<img src="check_router_yaw.jpg" width=480 height=390 align=left></a>
Next I'm checking that the router's axis is perpendicular to the link.  I'm using the same spacers
from the previous step to get the piece of wood that I'm measuring against parallel to the 
router mount.
<p>
Also check that the router's collet is the same distance from the pins on either side.  If it's
too hard to measure to the collet, then measure to the edge of the router's body.

<a href="check_router_pitch-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=561>
<img src="check_router_pitch.jpg" width=480 height=337 align=left></a>
Now checking that the router isn't tilted up or down with respect to its mount.
<p>
I'm using the same blocks of wood that I used in previous steps to support the router mount.
With the blocks all the same height, my router's axis should be exactly parallel to the table.
<p>
I put another piece of wood in front of the shaft in my router.  
The edges of this piece of wood are parallel
with the table.  If you look carefully at this photo, you can see that the 
shaft tilts slightly up towards the right.  You can click on the photo to enlarge it.

<a href="plug_up_hole-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=759>
<img src="plug_up_hole.jpg" width=480 height=455 align=left></a>
On my machine, I found the links to be accurate enough, but one of the holes I had drilled in the
router mount was off by a millimeter.  This tricky to fix.  A straightforward
approach would have been to just make a new part, and if it had been one of the simpler links,
that's what I would have done.  But with the router mount being so complicated, I didn't
want to go to the trouble of making a new one.
<p>
Essentially, a new hole needs to be drilled, but this new hole will overlap with the old hole.
<p>
The first step is to glue something in to the old hole to completely fill it, so that a new hole
may be drilled.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="redrill_hole-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=646>
<img src="redrill_hole.jpg" width=480 height=387 align=left></a>
Drilling a new hole partially overlapping the filled hole is a challenge.  The drill may be inclined
to drift towards or away from the filled hole, as the filled hole is not the same as the
surrounding material.  If you need to re-drill a hole, the key is to do it
with maximum rigidity in the setup.
<p>
Push the drill bit as far into the drill press chuck as possible so that there is only a short 
piece sticking out.  This cuts down on flexing in the drill.
Bring the stock up so that with the drill press's quill fully retracted, the drill is almost
touching the wood.  Drill press quills tend to have more play in them the further down they
extend. 
<p>
Also, use several clamps to rigidly clamp your work piece to the drill press's table, and make
sure the table is securely locked and level.  I swiveled the drill press table off to the left
a little bit so that I could better clamp my part onto it.
<p>
When you drill, set the drill press for a relatively high speed and drill slowly.  Back the drill
out after every few millimeter of drilling in to clear out the chips.

<a href="alignment_sanding-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=528>
<img src="alignment_sanding.jpg" width=480 height=317 align=left></a>
I also found that my router was not quite perpendicular to the mount in the jig.  A drum sander
would be ideal for opening up the mount to move the router.  I don't have a drum sander, so I used
a sanding drum in my drill press to sand away material where I needed to.
</p><br clear=left><p>
<a href="shim_with_uhmw-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=536>
<img src="shim_with_uhmw.jpg" width=480 height=322 align=left></a>
I needed to add shims on the side opposite to where I sanded.  For shimming a fraction of
a millimeter, I find that UHMW tape is very useful.  Each layer of UHMW tape adds about a 
quarter to a third of a millimeter in thickness (or about .010"), and the tape is fairly rigid.  
I applied about three layers of UHMW tape to the spot shown in the photo at left.
<p>
If you need to adjust the router alignment, it will probably take several tries, repeating the
checks listed above every time.

<a href="close_enough-b.jpg" bigw=800 bigh=584>
<img src="close_enough.jpg" width=480 height=350 align=left></a>
Putting the pantograph back together for another check.  I still assembled it without
the washers in place when I took the photo.  I still needed to take everything apart one 
more time to varnish everything.  The axis of the router was sufficiently parallel with
the table along its full side-to-side range of motion that I decided it was close enough.
